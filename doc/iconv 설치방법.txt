Step 1) building libiconv
libiconv is the standard GNU library supporting locale charsets.
Required by: libspatialite, spatialite-tools

Building under Windows is not too much difficult.

    download libiconv-1.13.1.tar.gz
    uncompress this gzipped-file
    then untar the tarball
    and finally open an MSYS shell

cd libiconv-1.13.1
./configure
make
make install-strip

Anyway, this will simply build and install the DLL: a further step is required in order to get the static library as well.

make distclean
./configure --disable-shared
make
make install-strip

Now you've built and installed both the static library and the DLL.
However the above process has installed badly misconfigured libcharset.la and libiconv.la files
(which are required to build other libraries in the following steps).
So in order to get a properly configured libiconv you have to accomplish a further operation:

    download libiconv.la and libcharset.la
    then copy both files: cp libiconv.la libcharset.la /usr/local/lib
